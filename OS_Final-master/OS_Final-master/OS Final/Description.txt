Disk class creates disk file
For every disk, we have a disk manager
Disk manager will access methods from disk class to perform operations
Super block -- take the first sector and use it to describe layout/partitions
Super block tells you how to find partitions
Disk manager calculates offsets to partitions
Only one opportunity to edit the super block
Disk manager needs to either init or read super block
One partition manager associates with every disk manager (only one in this case)
